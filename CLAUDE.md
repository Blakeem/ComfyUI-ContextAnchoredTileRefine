# Context-Anchored Tile Refine, project guide

Single-node ComfyUI custom node (v1.0.0). It refines an already-upscaled IMAGE by dynamic tiling,
or refines only a masked region of a large image without processing the rest. Upscaling happens
outside the node. Target: ComfyUI 0.3.45+, V1 node schema, Python 3.12, torch 2.9.

## Prime directives (highest priority, override convenience)

1. **Quality first, efficiency second.** Output image quality is the top priority and is never
   traded for speed, memory, or simpler code. Optimize only *after* quality is guaranteed, and
   never in a way that risks a visible quality regression. **Never resize, resample, or apply any
   lossy operation to a tile.** Tiles are extracted, processed, and pasted back at their native
   pixel size (multiples of 8 by construction).

2. **Never re-diffuse finished pixels that survive into the output.** Running diffusion again over
   already-refined content compounds grit with the samplers this node targets, visibly, even once
   and even untiled. This is the root constraint behind every seam decision below.

3. **Seams are hidden by conditioning, not by blending.**
   - *Between tiles:* each tile is sampled oversized (core + `context_overlap` + a frozen
     `context_anchor` halo). The anchor halo encodes from the live canvas, so the tile sees its
     already-refined neighbors and is drawn to continue them. On sides bordering an
     already-processed neighbor (top/left in raster order), the `context_overlap` band is diffused
     from the FROZEN RAW source by both tiles independently, and the two results are cross-dissolved
     by a thin directional feather. Prohibited: a wide blend of two independent refinements
     (ghosting), and a double hard-paste of a shared strip (compounding artifacts).
   - *At a mask boundary:* no feather at all. The masked region is diffused against the frozen
     background as context, then composited back with a 1px anti-alias only. An inward feather
     would under-process a ring around the subject; an outward feather would re-diffuse finished
     background (directive 2).

## Architecture (respect these invariants)

- `context_anchored_tile_refine/node.py`: the V1 node (`INPUT_TYPES` / `VALIDATE_INPUTS` /
  `refine`). Normalizes and validates the optional MASK. Comfy-free at module scope.
- `context_anchored_tile_refine/grid.py`: pure grid math (tile layout: `core`,
  `overlap_inner_rect`, `crop_rect`, `paste_rect`; `solve_axis`, `build_layout`).
  **Stdlib only**, no torch, no comfy.
- `context_anchored_tile_refine/sampling.py`: the pipeline. `refine_image` is the entry point.
  Without a mask it delegates to `_refine_tiles` (pad to /8, solve the grid, per-tile
  encode/sample/decode from a live canvas, directional-feather composite, crop back). With a mask
  it crops to the mask bbox plus `context_anchor`, gates every tile's denoise mask to the region,
  and composites back through a 1px anti-aliased edge, leaving everything outside byte-identical.
  **torch-only at module scope**; `comfy` / `latent_preview` are imported lazily inside functions
  (a subprocess test pins this).
- The denoise mask handed to the sampler is always **binary**. ComfyUI re-applies it every step,
  so a fractional cell is only ever partially denoised and leaves an under-refined halo at low
  step counts.
- Curated ComfyUI API references: `docs/reference/INDEX.md`. Tile-layout playground:
  `docs/tile-simulator.html`, a self-testing mirror of `grid.py`.

## Tests / gates

Venv python: `C:\Users\Blake\Documents\ComfyUI\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` (do not `pip install`).
- Default gate, must be green with **0 skips**: `<venv> -m pytest tests -m "not gpu"`
- GPU tests, real SD1.5 sampling: `<venv> -m pytest tests -m gpu -v`
- Markers: `comfy`, `gpu`, `slow`. GPU tests load
  `models\checkpoints\v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors`.
- The no-mask path is pinned byte-for-byte by hand-computed value tests. Treat them as the
  regression net for any change to `_refine_tiles`.
- Final judgement on seams is always the owner's visual A/B in ComfyUI, not a metric.

## Release

`pyproject.toml` `version` drives the Comfy Registry. Pushing a change to `pyproject.toml` on
`main` triggers `.github/workflows/publish_action.yml`, which needs the `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
repo secret. `.comfyignore` keeps `docs/`, `tests/`, `conftest.py`, and `.github/` out of the
published archive.

## Conventions

- Match ComfyUI core naming and comment style; comment only non-obvious constraints.
- Keep `grid.py` stdlib-only, and `node.py` / `sampling.py` module scopes comfy-free (lazy imports).
- Prefer views over copies and slice noise rather than redrawing it, but only after the prime
  directives above are satisfied.
